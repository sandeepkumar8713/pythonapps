# Question : You are given an array points containing the coordinates of points on a 2D plane,
# sorted by the x-values, where points[i] = [xi, yi] such that xi < xj for all 1 <= i < j <=
# points.length. You are also given an integer k. Return the maximum value of the equation
# yi + yj + |xi - xj| where |xi - xj| <= k and 1 <= i < j <= points.length. It is guaranteed
# that there exists at least one pair of points that satisfy the constraint |xi - xj| <= k.
#
# Example : Input: points = [[1,3],[2,0],[5,10],[6,-10]], k = 1
# Output: 4
