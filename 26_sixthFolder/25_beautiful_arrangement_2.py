# Question : Given two integers n and k, construct a list answer that contains n different positive
# integers ranging from 1 to n and obeys the following requirement:
# Suppose this list is answer = [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|,
# ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly k distinct integers.
# Return the list answer. If there multiple valid answers, return any of them.
#
# Example : Input: n = 3, k = 2
# Output: [1,3,2]
# Explanation: The [1,3,2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2,1] has
# exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.
