# https://leetcode.com/problems/max-chunks-to-make-sorted-ii/
# Question : You are given an integer array arr. We split arr into some number of chunks (i.e., partitions),
# and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.
# Return the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array.
#
# Example : Input: arr = [2,1,3,4,4]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: We can split into two chunks, such as [2, 1], [3, 4, 4].
# However, splitting into [2, 1], [3], [4], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
