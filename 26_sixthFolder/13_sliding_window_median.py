# Question : You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. There is a sliding window of size k
# which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers
# in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the median array for
# each window in the original array. Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted.
#
# Example : Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
# Output: [1.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,5.00000,6.00000]
