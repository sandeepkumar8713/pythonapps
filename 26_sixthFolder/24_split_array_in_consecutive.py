# Question You are given an integer array nums that is sorted in non-decreasing order.
# Determine if it is possible to split nums into one or more subsequences such that both of the following
# conditions are true:
# Each subsequence is a consecutive increasing sequence (i.e. each integer is exactly one more than the previous integer).
# All subsequences have a length of 3 or more.
# Return true if you can split nums according to the above conditions, or false otherwise.
#
# Example : Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
# Output: true
# Explanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:
# [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 3, 4, 5
