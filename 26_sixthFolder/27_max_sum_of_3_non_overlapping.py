# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-3-non-overlapping-subarrays/
# Question : iven an integer array nums and an integer k, find three non-overlapping subarrays of length
# k with maximum sum and return them. Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting
# position of each interval (0-indexed). If there are multiple answers, return the lexicographically
# smallest one.
#
# Example : Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,6,7,5,1], k = 2
# Output: [0,3,5]
# Explanation: Subarrays [1, 2], [2, 6], [7, 5] correspond to the starting indices [0, 3, 5].
# We could have also taken [2, 1], but an answer of [1, 3, 5] would be lexicographically larger.
