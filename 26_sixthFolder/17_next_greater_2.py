# https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/
# Question : Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]),
# return the next greater number for every element in nums. The next greater number of a number x is the
# first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly
# to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.
#
# Example : Input: nums = [1,2,1]
# Output: [2,-1,2]
