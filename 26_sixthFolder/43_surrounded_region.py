# Question : Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are
# 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'. A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in
# that surrounded region.
#
# Example : Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
# Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
