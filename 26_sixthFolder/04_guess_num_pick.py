# Question : We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:
# I pick a number between 1 and n.
# You guess a number.
# If you guess the right number, you win the game.
# If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower,
# and you will continue guessing.
# Every time you guess a wrong number x, you will pay x dollars. If you run out of money, you lose the game.
# Given a particular n, return the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win regardless of
# what number I pick.
