# Question : Given two strings str1 and str2 of the same length, determine whether you can
# transform str1 into str2 by doing zero or more conversions. In one conversion you can
# convert all occurrences of one character in str1 to any other lowercase English character.
# Return true if and only if you can transform str1 into str2.
#
# Example : Input: str1 = "aabcc", str2 = "ccdee"
# Output: true
# Explanation: Convert 'c' to 'e' then 'b' to 'd' then 'a' to 'c'. Note that the order of conversions matter.
#
# Example : Input: str1 = "leetcode", str2 = "codeleet"
# Output: false
# Explanation: There is no way to transform str1 to str2.
