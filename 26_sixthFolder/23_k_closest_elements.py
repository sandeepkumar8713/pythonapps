# Question : Given a sorted integer array arr, two integers k and x, return the k closest
# integers to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order.
# An integer a is closer to x than an integer b if:
# |a - x| < |b - x|, or
# |a - x| == |b - x| and a < b
#
# Example : Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = 3
# Output: [1,2,3,4]
