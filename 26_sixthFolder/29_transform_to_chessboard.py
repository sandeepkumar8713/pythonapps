# Question : You are given an n x n binary grid board. In each move, you can swap any two rows with each
# other, or any two columns with each other. Return the minimum number of moves to transform the board
# into a chessboard board. If the task is impossible, return -1. A chessboard board is a board where
# no 0's and no 1's are 4-directionally adjacent.
#
# Example : Input: board = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: One potential sequence of moves is shown.
# The first move swaps the first and second column.
# The second move swaps the second and third row.
