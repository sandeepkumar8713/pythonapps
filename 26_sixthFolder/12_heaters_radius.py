# Question : Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a
# fixed warm radius to warm all the houses. Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within
# the heater's warm radius range. Given the positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line,
# return the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses.
# Notice that all the heaters follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.
#
#
# Example : Input: houses = [1,2,3,4], heaters = [1,4]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4. We need to use radius 1 standard,
