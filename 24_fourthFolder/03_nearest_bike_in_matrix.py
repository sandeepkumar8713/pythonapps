# Question : Given a matrix of people(denoted by small alphabets) and bikes(denoted by capital alphabets),
# find the nearest bike for a given person. How will you change your solution if you have to find bikes for a
# set of people? (assuming multiple bikes can be at the same distance from 1 person)
#
# Used : Use BFS for first part of question. It is similar to firstFolder/05_find_dist_in_matrix.py
#        For part 2 please check above link, if solution is available.
# Complexity :
