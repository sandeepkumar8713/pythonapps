# Question : Write a program to reverse a stack using recursion. You are not allowed to use loop constructs
# like while, for..etc, and you can only use the following ADT functions on Stack S:
# isEmpty(S)
# push(S)
# pop(S)
#
# Question Type : ShouldSee
# Used : call recur func
#        Pop the top element.
#        call recur reverse func on remaining
#        call insert at bottom and insert the popped element.
# Complexity : O(n ^ 2)
# TODO :: add code
