# Question : Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
# Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
# Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
#
# Question Type : SimilarAdded
# Used : Traverse the graph using DFS, while doing so make a map of key(int) and value(Node)
#        Now loop over the map and make new graph.
