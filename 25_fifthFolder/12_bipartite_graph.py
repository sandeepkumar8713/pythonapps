# Question : A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two independent sets,
# U and V such that every edge (u, v) either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex from V to U.
# In other words, for every edge (u, v), either u belongs to U and v to V, or u belongs to V and
# v to U. We can also say that there is no edge that connects vertices of same set. A bipartite graph is possible
# if the graph coloring is possible using two colors such that vertices in a set are colored with the same color.
# Note that it is possible to color a cycle graph with even cycle using two colors.
# There is an ant colony with n ants. And there will be a total of m interactions between ants.
# So, ( a colony will be good only if all the interactions were between opposite genders). We have been giving
# the interactions between ants, and we have to find out whether this colony can be good or not. for eg:-
# Input:
# 3 3
# 1 2
# 2 3
# 1 3
# So there are a total of 3 ants and 3 interactions. ant 1 interact with ant 2, 2 with 3, and 1 with 3. we have to
# tell whether this colony can be good or not. So here this colony canâ€™t be good, as 1 interact with 2 and 3,
# so the gender of 2 and 3 should be the same, but 2 and 3 also interact so there is no possible way for this
# colony to be good
#
# Question Type : Generic
# Used : Maintain a color array of size n with 2 colors. Take one node as source and assign
#        1 color to it. Push this node in the queue. Do BFS over the graph using the queue.
#        While doing so, assign color to adjacent nodes. If we get a adjacent node whose color
#        is same, the return False.
#        If we come out of the loop, return True.
# Complexity : O(n)
