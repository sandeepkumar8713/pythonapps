# Question : A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that
# city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the
# skyline formed by these buildings collectively.
#
# The geometric information of each building is given in the array buildings where buildings[i] =
# [lefti, righti, heighti]:
# lefti is the x coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.
# righti is the x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.
# heighti is the height of the ith building.
#
# You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.
