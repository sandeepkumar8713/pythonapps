# Question : Transform QR code type matrix to a barcode type matrix. Given a binary matrix (only 0's & 1's) of m x n
# and numbers x & y, where x <= y. Flip numbers in a column to either 0s or 1s such that a block is either all 0s or
# all 1s. The resulting block should be atleast x columns & atmost y columns wide. Minimize the number of flips
# required for this transformation.
