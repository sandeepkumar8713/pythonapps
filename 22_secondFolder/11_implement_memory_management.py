# Question : Design Memory Management System and tell about all the data structures you will use and why. How will
# you allocate and deallocate the memory using those data structure and Time & Space complexity of the operations.
#
# 1 Answer

# You can design a very primitive algorithm.
# For memory allocation: Have a circular linked list, and can implement couple of algorithms such as first bit, best fit
# and next fit.
