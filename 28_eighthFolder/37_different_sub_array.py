# https://leetcode.com/problems/subarrays-with-k-different-integers/
# Question : Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of good subarrays of nums.
# A good array is an array where the number of different integers in that array is exactly k.
# For example, [1,2,3,1,2] has 3 different integers: 1, 2, and 3.
# A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
