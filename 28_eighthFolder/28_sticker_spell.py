# https://leetcode.com/problems/stickers-to-spell-word/
# Question : We are given n different types of stickers. Each sticker has a lowercase English
# word on it. You would like to spell out the given string target by cutting individual letters
# from your collection of stickers and rearranging them. You can use each sticker more than once
# if you want, and you have infinite quantities of each sticker.
# Return the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out target. If the task is impossible,
# return -1.
#
# Input: stickers = ["with","example","science"], target = "thehat"
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# We can use 2 "with" stickers, and 1 "example" sticker.
# After cutting and rearrange the letters of those stickers, we can form the target "thehat".
# Also, this is the minimum number of stickers necessary to form the target string.
