# Question : Given a positive integer n, return the number of the integers in the range [0, n] whose
# binary representations do not contain consecutive ones.
#
# Input: n = 5
# Output: 5
# Here are the non-negative integers <= 5 with their corresponding binary representations:
# 0 : 0
# 1 : 1
# 2 : 10
# 3 : 11
# 4 : 100
# 5 : 101
# Among them, only integer 3 disobeys the rule (two consecutive ones) and the other 5 satisfy the rule.
