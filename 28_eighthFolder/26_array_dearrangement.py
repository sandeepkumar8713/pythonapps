# Question : n combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set,
# such that no element appears in its original position. There's originally an array consisting of n
# integers from 1 to n in ascending order, you need to find the number of derangement it can generate.
# Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod 109 + 7.
#
# Example : Input: 3
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The original array is [1,2,3]. The two derangements are [2,3,1] and [3,1,2].
