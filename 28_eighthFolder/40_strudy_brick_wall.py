# Question : You are given integers height and width which specify the dimensions of a brick wall you are
# building. You are also given a 0-indexed array of unique integers bricks, where the ith brick has a height
# of 1 and a width of bricks[i]. You have an infinite supply of each type of brick and bricks may not be rotated.
# Each row in the wall must be exactly width units long. For the wall to be sturdy, adjacent rows in the wall
# should not join bricks at the same location, except at the ends of the wall.
# Return the number of ways to build a sturdy wall. Since the answer may be very large,
# return it modulo 109 + 7.
