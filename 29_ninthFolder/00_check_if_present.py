# 1. Divide data into chunks of size
# 2. Sort each chuck one by one save in HDD
# 3. Apply technique of 11_merge_k_sorted_list.py. While merging on heap of size k will be loaded in memory.

# Create duplicate of a node and insert it in between that node and the node just next to it.
# Now for a node X its duplicate will be X->next and the arbitrary pointer of the duplicate will point to X->arbit->next
# [as that is the duplicate of X->arbit]
