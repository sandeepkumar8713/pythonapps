# You are given an array of integers of size n. Your task is to count the number of pairs (i, j) which f
# ollows below conditions:
# => 0 < i < j < n
# => arr[i] + reverse(arr[j]) == arr[j] + reverse(arr[i])
# Examples:
# [42, 32, 53, 76, 13] -> 2
# 1. (42, 53) => 42 + 35 == 24 + 53
# 2. (32, 76) => 32 + 67 == 23 + 76
