# Question : Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space p1, p2, p3 and p4, return true if the
# four points construct a square. The coordinate of a point pi is represented as [xi, yi].
# The input is not given in any order. A valid square has four equal sides with positive
# length and four equal angles (90-degree angles).
#
# Example : Input: p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,1]
# Output: true
