# https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-boomerangs/
# Question : You are given n points in the plane that are all distinct, where points[i] = [xi, yi].
# A boomerang is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance
# between i and k (the order of the tuple matters). Return the number of boomerangs.
#
# Example : Input: points = [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]].
